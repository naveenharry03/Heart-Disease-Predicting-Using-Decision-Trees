# Heart-Disease-Predicting-Using-Decision-Trees

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease based on attributes such as gender, age, and cholesterol levels using decision trees. By creating a flowchart-like diagram, the model assists in identifying individuals with or without heart disease using hyperparameters such as max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf and criterion (Gini/IG or entropy), and understand how they impact the model performance.The dataset comprises patient test results and personal details, with heart disease labeled as 1 for presence and 0 for absence, while gender labeled as 0 for females and 1 for males. This predictive model benefits healthcare professionals by providing a valuable tool for early detection and diagnosis, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.
